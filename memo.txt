Subject: Monte Carlo Cereal Purchase Simulation

The purpose of this memo is to inform you of the Monte Carlo simulation that I've performed on the purchasing patterns 
customers will need to exhibit in order to obtain all of the toys that we will be including in our upcoming promotions. 
I've calculated the results for two scenarios:

1. The toys are placed in boxes with equal probability.

2. The toys (1 through 4) are placed in the boxes with corresponding probabilities 0.10, 0.25, 0.25, 0.40.

I simulated how many boxes a given customer would have to purchase in order to collect one of each toy, and did that 
10,000 times. We can assume that the statistics generated from this simulation will be approximately equal to the actual
statistics for our real life customers.

If the toys are placed in boxes with equal probability, customers will have to purchase an average of 8.3 boxes of 
cereal to get at least one of each toy. The true average number of boxes likely is contained in the interval 8.25 - 8.4.
The proportion of customers who will have to purchase at least 14 boxes to obtain at least one of each toy is .095. The
true proportion likely is contained in the interval .089 - .101.

If the toys are placed according to scenario 2, customers will have to purchase an average of 12.07 boxes of 
cereal to get at least one of each toy. The true average number of boxes likely is contained in the interval 11.9 - 12.23.
The proportion of customers who will have to purchase at least 14 boxes to obtain at least one of each toy is .29. The
true proportion likely is contained in the interval .28 - .298.

I hope that this information is useful and can inform your decisions as you move forward with the promotion.
